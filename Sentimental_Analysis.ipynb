    "1. I would use the feedback data that i got from the models and the classification to apply sentimental analysis.\n",
    "2. If the feeback was text, i would then need to convert all the text into lower case and i would also need to remove all the common words that do not carry any significant meaning to ensure my feedback text/data is clean.\n",
    "3. i would then need to convert all of my feedbck data that is clean and processed into numerical format that would make it possible for the format to be added to any model.\n",
    "4. There are many sentimental analysis approaches but in machine learning specifically you can train a sentiment classifier using a labeled data but only if you have categorized your data between positive, negative or neutral.\n",
    "5. You can also use classification models like logistic regression or naive bayes for that matter to classify the new feedback data based on the learned data.\n",
    "6. For deeper learning purposes I suggest LSTM as a more sophisticated approach on my nd but there are still more stronger models that can learn complex patterns than him"
